# TriviaGame

Game Rules:

A game starts by clicking on a “Start” button and consists of 5 questions.

Each question has only one correct answer which will be randomly situated in the list of answers.

If you answered the question incorrectly, a correct answer and a picture will show up next.

You have 30 seconds to think about the question. If you don’t pick any answer and time is out, the system will move to the next question and timer will start over counting down from 30 to 0.

At the end the game you will get final scores – how many questions were answered correctly, incorrectly, or unanswered. 

There is an option to start the game over by clicking “Start Over” button.


Good luck!
